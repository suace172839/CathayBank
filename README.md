# CathayBank

This project is for LogicalCodingTest and AutomationTest.
All the scripts were developed in Python3.
Due to the lack of time, PyTest is not used.


# LogicalCodingTest X.py
Files "LogicalCodingTest X.py" are for the second part "LogicalCodingTest".
In the bottom of each scripts, there're some testcases that I think should be tested for unit test.


# AutomationTest
Files under directory "AutomationTest" are for the third part "AutomationTest".
"log.py" and "web.py" are library files.

After executing the program, directories "log" and "output" will be created.
With the module "logging", the logs will be stored under "log" with timestamps as filename.
All the output results and screenshots will be saved under "output".
